                <p><strong>The intelligent Investor - Graham</strong></p>
                <p>
                  This classic book on investing belongs on the bookshelf of every investor. The principles that Benjamin Graham
                  outlines are the very precepts that guided such great investors as Warren Buffett, and such mutual fund innovators as
                  John Bogle, the noted Vanguard Group founder, who wrote this edition's foreword. First published in 1949, the text
                  shows a few signs of age  most notably in its discussion of interest rates, investment vehicles such as savings bonds
                  and other time-sensitive subjects. However, those are minor issues. When Benjamin Graham writes about categories
                  of investors, approaches to security analysis, the proper disposition investors should have toward market moves, and
                  other fundamental investment subjects, his advice is timeless.

                <p>Warren Buffett is “everyman” as multibillionaire. Despite his vast wealth, he has always eschewed ostentation. He
                pays himself about $100,000 annually, which in today’s U.S. economy places him in the upper-middle-class. He
                lives in the same simple Omaha, Nebraska, house that he bought in 1958 for $31,500. He prefers an old gray suit to
                expensive London tailoring. In Buffett’s early days, when he was only a multimillionaire and not a multibillionaire,
                he walked around with holes in the soles of his shoes. To Buffett, wardrobe doesn’t matter; what matters is making
                money. He is better at this pursuit than anyone else in the world. In 2008, Forbes magazine ranked him as the globe’s
                richest man, with a net worth of $62.3 billion. Author Alice Schroeder does a masterful job of chronicling Buffett’s
                improbable, inspiring life. As a former superstar research analyst, Schroeder uses her expert knowledge of finance
                and commerce to detail Buffett’s investment philosophy and business activities."</p>

                <p><strong>Real Venture Capital - Thompson</strong></p>
                <p>This brief book offers a sound introduction to the fundamentals of venture capital
                investing. Though it emphasizes the United Kingdom, it illustrates the state of the venture
                capital business in other nations as well. Richard Thompson gives a straightforward
                explanation of what “real venture capital” is. He distinguishes venture capital for new
                business development from private equity, or refinancing, for established companies. Case
                studies and anecdotes from the author’s own experience support his plain, commonsense
                recommendations.</p>
